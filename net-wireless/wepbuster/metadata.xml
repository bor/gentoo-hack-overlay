		This small utility was written for information security professional to
		aid in conducting Wireless Security Assessment. The script executes 
		various programs included in the aircrack-ng suite - a set of tools for 
		auditing wireless networks, in order to obtain the WEP encryption key of
		a wireless access point. WEPBuster also has a wordlist generator 
		which can be used in creating "dictionary" files for WPA Pre-Shared Key
		cracking and for other related tasks.
