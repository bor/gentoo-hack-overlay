		Implementation of an offline dictionary attack against WPA/WPA2 networks
		using PSK-based authentication (e.g. WPA-Personal). Many enterprise
		networks deploy PSK-based authentication mechanisms for WPA/WPA2 since
		it is much easier than establishing the necessary RADIUS, supplicant and
		certificate authority architecture needed for WPA-Enterprise
		authentication. Cowpatty can implement an accelerated attack if a
		precomputed PMK file is available for the SSID that is being assessed.
